Poseidon Playlister is a simple, lightweight GTK2 frontend to MPD, the music player
daemon.

To install:
  cabal install all needed packages:
    NOTE: gtk2hs-buildtools needs to be installed before gtk, but cabal won't
          give an error message for it
  cabal build
  cabal run

This will automatically connect to a mpd server for grading/testing.

Navigate your web-browser to http://lenore.kedki.me:8000 to listen to the
resulting http stream of music.
