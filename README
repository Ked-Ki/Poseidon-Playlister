Poseidon Playlister is a simple, lightweight GTK2 frontend to MPD, the music player
daemon.

To install:
  cabal install all needed packages:
    NOTE: gtk2hs-buildtools needs to be installed before gtk, but cabal won't
          give an error message for it
  cabal build
  cabal run

This will automatically connect to a mpd server for grading/testing.

Navigate your web-browser to http://lenore.kedki.me:8000 to listen to the
resulting http stream of music.

Use:
  When booted up, Poseidon displays two panels. The left one represents the
  current playlist, and the right one the entire music library.

  Use the add button on the far right to add songs from the library to the
  playlist.

  Use the filter, nub, and remove buttons on the far left to remove songs from
  the playlist. 

  Use the "By <x>" checkboxes in the middle to choose whether the above
  operations work only on the song selected, or on all songs that are in the
  same artist, or album, etc.
